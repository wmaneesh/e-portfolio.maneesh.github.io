              <p>
                I will be going into my last year of Computer Engineering at
                York University. The reason I love this program is because it’s
                a combination of both electrical engineering and software
                engineering. I have always been passionate about learning
                robotics and I realized that Computer Engineering is the stream
                that has most integration with robotics and will allow me to
                gain the necessary knowledge to achieve my future goals.<br /><br />
                For the past two years I have been fortunate enough to land two
                co-op positions. One at CIBC as an IT-Project Coordinate and the
                other at 4PAY as a Technical Analyst. These two positions
                allowed me to gain valuable industry experience which will help
                me immensely in my future career. The working environment was
                quite different between CIBC and 4PAY because CIBC was a rather
                large financial corporation, while 4PAY a small fintrec company.
                This played a big role in the amount of experience I gained and
                the learning I did. 4PAY had a higher rewarding experience for
                me because of the small team structure they had. This let do a
                great closely-knit community. Unlike my placement at CIBC, I was
                able to engage with my co-workers and learn from them a lot
                more. CIBC, being a large financial institution, had its
                downside of having a complex working environment.<br /><br />
                My future career goal would be to take my skills I learned as a
                Project Coordinator and a Technical Analyst and apply it secure
                a position as a Project Manager for a software or embedded
                development company. The experience I’ve gained during my co-op
                placement is invaluable as it directly correlates to my career
                goals in the future.

              Several Scripts to Automate Tasks.<br />
              One of my first few tasks at 4PAY was to create a script to
              automate some tasks which allowed me to analyse and document the
              applications they possessed. Since I was free to use any language
              to write the scripts, I tired writing some of the smaller scripts
              using JavaScript and the main scripts were written in Bash. The
              first Script I created was written in JavaScript and it was
              responsible of logging all the API calls on a product that 4PAY
              uses. Due to confidentiality, I am unable to show the code,
              however, the structure of the log file can be shown.

              A conceptual BlockChain for Accounting <br />
              BlockChain was a topic that was always interested in and I
              mentioned it my manager. This gave me the opportunity to present a
              proof of concept to the team on how BlockChain can be implemented
              for the maintaining a secure history of the accounts used at 4PAY.
              I was able to use my knowledge of crypto currency and distributed
              ledgers to create a conceptual blockchain that can hold the
              necessary account information for the team securely. The Image
              shown is when I was testing dummy data to present to the team.

              As Engineering students we’re all familiar with System

              projects related to system documentation and design in our
              courses, so I was rather comfortable creating them for 4Pay
              applications. The image shown displays a simple diagram that was
